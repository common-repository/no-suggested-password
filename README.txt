AS OF WP 5.7, THIS PLUGIN IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED.
Clears the initial suggested password on the WP 4.3+ password reset page.  This is a simplified version of our free Clarify Password Reset plugin.

== Description ==

PLEASE NOTE: AS OF WP 5.7, THIS PLUGIN IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED.

Since WordPress 4.3, new users are no longer sent their passwords directly by email.  Instead, they are sent a message containing a link to the Reset Password page, where they can choose their own password.  Additionally, the Reset Password page now appears with a strong password already suggested in the "New password" field.

This plugin removes the suggested password from the Reset Password page, because often users assume that their password has already been set to this new suggested password (leading to repeated password reset requests, frustration and unnecessary helpdesk queries.)

== Installation ==

1. Install this plugin via the WordPress plugin control panel, 
or by manually downloading it and uploading the extracted folder 
to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's all! There are no configurable options for this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin force users to choose strong passwords? =

No. Other plugins can be used for that.

= Can my users still get a password suggestion? =

No.  Please use our "Clarify Password Reset" plugin if you want a
"Suggest a password" button, plus other helpful functionality.
